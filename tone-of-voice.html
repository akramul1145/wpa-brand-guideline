                            <p class="mx-700">Padel is a game anyone can pick up — and our language should reflect that. While experienced players can easily understand words meant for newcomers, the reverse isn’t true. That’s why most of our tone should welcome every player, without assuming too much prior knowledge.</p>
                            <p class="mx-700">We speak to shared experiences — the thrill of a long rally, the joy of connecting with friends on court, the excitement of learning a new shot. These are universal. When it’s time to speak to advanced players or professionals, we can lean into technical terms — but always in the right place, never at the expense of accessibility.</p>

                            <p>Exclamation points are rare. The game itself carries energy; our words don't need to shout. One exclamation point is acceptable in kids programs or playful social posts, but never more than one per statement.</p>
                            <p>Avoid vague comparisons. Words like better, stronger, faster mean little without context. If we make comparisons, they should be specific: “Our courts are designed to reduce strain on your knees, so you can play longer.”</p>
